    <h3>TYPE COERCION:</h3>
    <p>When checking if a given variable is the same, we are used to using the logical operator == from java to check, if they are "the same". <br>
    However, in javascript, we don't have a compiler to tell us if two given variables are the same type when writing the code.<br>
    Therefore, if we want to make a hard check, to see if 2 and '2' are the same, we would be using ===<br>
    This makes sure that the two "numbers" are actually both numbers, and not just a number and a parsed string.<br>
    The strict equality === doesn't implicitly convert any of the values.</p>
    
    
    <h3>STRINGS AND NUMBERS:</h3>
    
    <p>Parsing strings with numbers into floats or Numbers:
    Whenever a number is returned as a string, convert it using 
    Number(string) or parseFloat(string).
    Using <p class="code">Number()</p> instead of parse to make sure it's a "clean" number, since parseInt(123asd2) would return 123 only.
    </p>
    
    <p>Print a number with decimals with 
        <p class="code">number.toFixed(amountOfDecimals)</p></p>
    
    <p>When using a string, you can get a character by it's index with:
        <p class="code">string.charAt(index)</p></p>
    
    <p>If you want to replace a character or substring, you can use
        <p class="code">string.replace("thingToReplace", "thingThatReplaces")</p></p>
    



<h3>OBJECTS:</h3>

<p>If you wanna access a value by a key, you can use:
    <p class="code">object.keyname</p></p>

<p>When defining an object, use this syntax
    <p class="code">myObject = { key: value, key: "value" }</p></p>

<p>You can further increase the objects keyvalue pairs with
    <p class="code">myObject.newKey = newValue;</p></p>

<p>Or delete it with
    <p class="code">delete myObject.key</p></p>

<div>
<h3>ARRAYS:</h3>

<p>You can access arrays directly with indexes:
    <p class="code">array[indexToAccess]</p></p>

<p>If you need more objects in the array, add with with push
    <p class="code">array.push( newObject    . or maybe {object in here} )</p></p>

<p>Get the index of first occurrence of that value.
    <p class="code">array.indexOf(thingToFind). Returns -1 if not found.</p></p>

<p>If you want to add to an array on a specific spot, use splice. Splice can also remove.
    <p class="code">array.splice(startIndex to insert/delete, how many things to replace, "stringToInsert")</p></p>

<p>pop() can be used to remove the last in an array
    <p class="code">array.pop()</p></p>

<p>If you want to copy an array, either slice it, map it or use the spread operator.
    <p class="code">newArray = array.slice( (optional start), (optional end) )<br>
newArray = array.map ( x => x)<br>
newArray = [...array]</p></p>

<h3>FUNCTIONS:</h3>

<p>Anonymous functions are nameless functions, such as
    <p class="code">const variable = function (x,y) { return x+y }<br>
const variable = (x,y) => {return x+y}<br>
const variable = (x,y) => x+y    in oneliners</p></p>

<p>Functions are hoisted when a script is run. This makes it possible for javascript to read and call methods that are declared further down in the script.</p>

<p>When using functions, you can pass another function as an argument. This is called a callback function.
such as:
<p class="code">function someAction(anotherFunction, variable) { anotherFunction(variable)}</p>



<h3>LOOPS:</h3>

<p>When using loops in javascript, avoid for loops as it's errorprone because of int indexing.
Furthermore, they are overly verbose and aren't functional. Luckily there are loop methods that solve these problems
We are looking for a way to have immutable data, so avoid operating directly inside arrays.
If you need to iterate and "throw away" the data, you can use a forEach.
If you need immutable data structures or copies of arrays, use map (or spread operator)</p>


<p class="code">const discountedPhones = smartPhones.map(smartPhone => {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  return {...smartPhone, price:  smartPhone.price - 500 };
});</p>

<p>You can also filter out elements you dont want. filter() returns a new array, same goes for map.</p>

<p class="code">const cheapPhones = smartPhones.filter(phone => phone.price <= 4000)</p>
